## **_BIG PROJECT_**

### **About**
Our _company_ was tasked with fixing a lot of badly written, unoptimized and quite shameful mathematical libraries that were meant for a **Scientific Exhibition**.   
The task is really straightforward but the _Product Owner_ wants us to develop a demo or PoC-like program to give periodic report on the updating/fixing process.    
So we host this _demo_ program in this repository.

Please consult the documentation for further details regarding the order and its related tasks!
